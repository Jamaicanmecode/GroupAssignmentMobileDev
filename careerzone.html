<h1>Career Advice</h1>
<p>When it comes to your career, sometimes it feels like you could use all the advice you can get. From picking the "right" career to actually excelling in it, there's certainly a lot to
learn.he best career or job is the one in which you’re using the skills you enjoy. But, not every job needs to address all of your passions.
Use every job as an opportunity to learn something new and keep an open mind; you may find that you really enjoy something you never imagined would appeal to you.</p>

<ul>
  <li> Every person you meet is a potential door to a new opportunity—personally or professionally. Build good bridges even in that just-for-now job,
  because you never know how they’ll weave into the larger picture of your life. </li>
  <li>No matter how low on the totem poll you are or how jaded you’ve become by your to-do list, it’s still important to show up early, and
  wear something sharp.</li>
  <li>No matter what you do, you’ll make it through. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.
  The thing they don’t tell you is that it nearly kills you.</li>
</ul>
        <p>In many instances, it’s almost unfair how companies perceive their employees. An employee that does just enough to keep his job and maintains an acceptable level of productivity is actually seen as disposable. Your company is only loyal to you as long as you offer value to the company.
            Who should you be loyal to in your career pursuits? You should be loyal to yourself. Is it in your best interest to move on to new company and seek out a new challenge? If you feel it’s time to move on, then make the move.
            Of course, you should show respect for your employer and gratitude for having a job. That should be a given.
            But you don't need to go out of your way to show loyalty to a company that could replace you tomorrow.</p>
        <h2>Searching For a Job</h2>
        <p>When you are searching for a job, its best to treat the search like a career.  Keep a schedule, create task lists and execute them, and do everything you would do if you had a job. When you walk into an interview with the glow of someone who has a task to complete, you’ll change your interviewer’s demeanor.
            You cannot fake confidence.
            If you’re putting out resumes and scheduling interviews, then that kind of confidence comes out when you sit down and talk to a hiring manager.
            If you’re looking for a job but are currently working, then don’t act like you’re sneaking around.
            Stand tall and give strong handshakes when you walk through the door of a hiring manager to talk about your next career move.</p>
